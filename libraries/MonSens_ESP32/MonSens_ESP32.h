 * @brief MonSens implementation for the wireless ESP32 microcontroller board.
 *
 * The ESP32 offers a large amount of dynamic and persistent memory and plenty
 * of pins to connect multiple sensors on a single unit. There are multiple
 * revisions of it, but all of them should be usable for MonSens applications.
